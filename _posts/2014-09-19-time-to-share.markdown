There is 100 levels of geekiness. I began at level 1 several years ago. I believe I am now at level 25, and know enough about computers and technology to share my thoughts and preferences with the world.
I will talk about **GNU/Linux, free software, FreeBSD, my hate for Microsoft products, web, programming**, I believe now you have an idea of the subject so I'll stop the list here.

Although I am French, this place will be in English, because more people can read and understand it this way, and also because computers related stuff is en English and I believe it makes sense to speak the same language to talk about it. Nobody wants to read Franglish, at least not me.

The software powering the website is [jekyll][], this way I can use [vim][], my favorite text editor as you will probably see in the following posts.

Thanks for reading :)
