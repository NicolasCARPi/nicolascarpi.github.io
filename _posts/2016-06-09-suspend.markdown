This post is to sum up the changes I needed to make to the suspend function.

## Using systemd for suspend

At the end of the day, I put my computer in sleep mode with this command: `sudo systemctl suspend`.

But anyone can resume it from sleep and access the computer. So I needed to launch `slock` before to lock the screen.

## Using systemd hooks

Fortunately, systemd allows you to have hooks. In `/etc/systemd/system/`, add a file `suspend@user.service`.

Here is the file:

{% highlight conf %}
[Unit]
Description=User suspend actions
Before=sleep.target

[Service]
User=user
Type=simple
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
ExecStart=/usr/bin/slock

[Install]
WantedBy=sleep.target
{% endhighlight %}

Now, when the computer is waking up, slock is launched \o/
