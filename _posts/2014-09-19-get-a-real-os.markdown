If you are already using an open source Operating System (OS) like GNU/Linux, then you can safely ignore this post. fi.

If you are using Windows or Mac OS X, and you are interested in increasing your geekiness, you should read ahead.

***Why the need for an open source OS ?***

* Because proprietary software blocks you from learning how a software works (so you can't fix it if it's broken).
* Because having to pay to be able to use your computer should never happen.
* Because *at a time when technology becomes ubiquitous, either one controls it, or get controlled by it.*
* Because you should care about privacy.
* Because free and open source software is often [better written and has less bugs][] than proprietary software.


***Ok, but what to use ?***

The most popular GNU/Linux distribution for beginners is Ubuntu. But I wouldn't recommend it. You should try Fedora.
You need to install [Virtualbox][] on your machine, and then you can try out some distributions. Do that for several weeks before you install GNU/Linux on a hard drive.

You want to learn the basics of the command line, like `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, what is $PATH, what is a shell, etcâ€¦

***What else ?***

My favorite GNU/Linux distribution is Archlinux. You should try it once you've mastered the command line ;)
