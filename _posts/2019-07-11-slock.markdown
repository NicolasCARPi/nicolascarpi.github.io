My lock screen is a pixelated view of the current screen:


[![scrot](/img/scrot.png)](/img/scrot.png)

Here is how it's done.

First, you need to install `scrot`, `imagemagick` and `i3lock`:

~~~bash
sudo pacman -Sy scrot imagemagick i3lock
~~~

Then, place this script somewhere in your $PATH (`~/.bin` is a good place):

~~~bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# first take a screenshot of the current screen
scrot /tmp/screen.png
# make it small then big again
convert /tmp/screen.png -scale 20% -scale 1000% -resize 1920x1200! /tmp/screen.png
# lock the screen with this pixelated image
i3lock -i /tmp/screen.png
~~~

The last step is to bind a shortcut that calls this script. I use Super-$, and because I use Awesome WM, the code looks like this:

~~~lua
awful.key({ modkey,      }, "$", function () awful.util.spawn("lock.sh") end,
        {description = "lock screen", group = "utils"}),
~~~

To unlock, directly type your user password.
