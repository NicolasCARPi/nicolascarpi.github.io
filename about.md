Hello, my name is Nicolas CARPi, and I'm a geek.

*Audience says : «Hello Nicolas.»*

My geek life started with these bad boys in the mid-nineties:

I had a computer programming class on Wednesdays where we would write BASIC code (and understanding about 0.1% of what the teacher was saying), and then we would play Sim City at the end of the lesson. That was the best part. Jokes about the teacher's name were cool too. He was called "Dino".

At home I we had something like this:

And some years later I finally had my own computer, an iMac with 6Gb of storage and a 233 MHz processor:

And that was the start of countless hours in front of the computer screen…

Years later, I'm running Archlinux as main OS for home and work, and I own a few servers (2 OpenBSD and 1 Ubuntu).

Welcome to this blog. Good nerding!

~Nico
