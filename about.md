Hello, my name is Nicolas CARPi, and I'm a geek.

*Audience says : «Hello Nicolas.»*

I began geeking when I was a child, on an iMac (I'm not that old, it had a hard drive of 6 Go and it stills boot !), and I slowly went up the ladder of geekiness. First by using free software, then by using cli applications, then by using more free software, and mastering the cli, etc…

Now I want to share about what I find cool or uncool. So welcome :)

~Nico
